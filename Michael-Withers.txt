* git clone into a local file using your terminal
* in terminal in cloned file create a branch -> git checkout -b "firstname-lastname"
* make a small change to project -> add -> commit -> git push origin firstname-lastname
* go back to Github repo, click compare & pull request button
* click base fork: dropdown -> select firstname-lastname/project-name
* click reviewers button, add TL as collaborator NOTE: If TL name doesn't pop up when you type it in for reviewer it's because they haven't accepted your collaborator invite. DM them and ask them to accept.
* click create pull request

* Head back over to your project and start working. 
    * Git add .
    * Git commit -m “insert message”
